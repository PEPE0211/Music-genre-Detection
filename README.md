# Music Genre Detection using GTZAN Dataset


## Introduction

Music Genre Detection using the GTZAN dataset is a machine learning project that focuses on automatically classifying music tracks into different genres. Leveraging the GTZAN dataset, a prominent benchmark in music genre recognition, this project explores various machine learning techniques to accurately predict and categorize music based on its genre.

Understanding the genre of a song has applications in recommendation systems, content tagging, and enhancing music streaming platforms. The project's primary goal is to develop models capable of discerning different music genres from audio tracks.

Stay tuned to explore the world of music genres with the power of machine learning!
